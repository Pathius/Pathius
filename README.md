I am a passionate programmer from Poland who loves to take care of his dog, travel, and explore the automotive industry in my free time. Currently, I reside in Radom, Poland, and have been working remotely since the beginning of my career.

Over the years, I have gained experience in implementing more than 10 different commercial projects. I have worked on both MVP-based solutions and maintained large-scale projects. My proficiency in Vue.js and React.js gives me the flexibility to adapt to any project requirement. I pride myself on my communication skills, which allow me to effectively communicate with clients and deliver according to their expectations. Additionally, I possess mentoring skills that I use to assist fellow programmers in their day-to-day development. I have even led a team of programmers in one of my previous projects.
